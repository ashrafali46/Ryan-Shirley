# About This Project
The aim on this project was to build a lightning fast website built with a JavaScript framework that would be hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). The framework that I chose to use was [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/). This made the development of [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/) much more organised which in turn sped up the development process.

The website is my own personal website to showcase a small portion of my work along with some information about me.

## Firebase
The project is hosted on firebase and can be visited [here](https://ryanshirley.ie/).

## Build Setup
In the project directory, you can run:

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
